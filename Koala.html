<p>Koalas are herbivore marsupials that live in the eucalyptus forests of eastern Australia. They have brownish-grey or silver-grey fur, a big pink or black nose, and sharp claws which help them to climb.</p>
<p>Koalas are mostly active at night. They live in trees and are rarely found on the ground. They eat leaves of Eucalyptus trees. Koalas do not drink often, they get most of their water from the Eucalyptus leaves.</p>
<p>Koalas live alone most of the time, but they have a social hierarchy with the other koalas who live near.</p>
