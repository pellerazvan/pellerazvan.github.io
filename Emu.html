<p>The emu is the second-largest living bird by height, after the ostrich. It is endemic to Australia where it is the largest native bird. The emu's range covers most of mainland Australia.</p>
<p>Emus are soft-feathered, brown, flightless birds with long necks and legs, and can reach up to 1.9 metres in height. Emus can travel great distances, and when necessary can sprint at 50 km/h; they forage for a variety of plants and insects, but have been known to go for weeks without eating. They drink infrequently, but take in copious amounts of water when the opportunity arises.</p>
