<h1>Blue Whale</h1>
<p>The blue whale is a marine mammal belonging to the baleen whales (Mysticeti). At up to 29.9 metres in length and with a maximum recorded weight of 173 tonnes and probably reaching over 181 tonnes, it is the largest animal known to have ever existed. Long and slender, the blue whale's body can be various shades of bluish-grey dorsally and somewhat lighter underneath.</p>
<p>Blue whales feed almost exclusively on krill, though they also take small numbers of copepods.</p>
