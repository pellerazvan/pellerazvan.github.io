<h1>Beef and Diary Industry</h1>
<img src="Images/Cows.jpg" alt="Cows" style="width: 250px;" align="right" hspace="10">
<p>The beef industry is the largest agricultural enterprise in Australia, and it is the second largest beef exporter, behind Brazil, in the world. All states and territories of Australia support cattle breeding in a wide range of climates.</p>
<p>Dairy products are Australia's fourth most valuable agricultural export. Domestic milk markets were heavily regulated until the 1980s, particularly for milk used for domestic fresh milk sales. This protected smaller producers in the northern states who produced exclusively for their local markets.</p>
