<h1>Fish</h1>

<p>Australia has over 5000 described species of fish, a quarter of which are endemic. Seafood and aquaculture are major and highly regulated industries.</p>
<p>Australia's fish population has had tens of millions of years to evolve and adapt to the unique aquatic environments of this massive, isolated island continent, so it's hardly surprising that many species are found nowhere else on earth. However even those species you might be familiar with, such as black marlin and some types of tuna, tend to be more abundant and grow larger here than almost anywhere else.</p>
