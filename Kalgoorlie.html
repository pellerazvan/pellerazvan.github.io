<p>Kalgoorlie, part of the City of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, is a city in the Goldfields-Esperance region of Western Australia. The town was founded in 1893 during the Coolgardie gold rush, and is located close to the so-called "Golden Mile". It is also the ultimate destination of the Goldfields Water Supply Scheme and the Golden Pipeline Heritage Trail.</p>
<p>The mining of gold, along with other metals such as nickel, has been a major industry in Kalgoorlie, and today employs about one-quarter of Kalgoorlie's workforce and generates a significant proportion of its income.</p>
