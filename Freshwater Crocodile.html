<p>The freshwater crocodile, also known as the Australian freshwater crocodile or Johnstone's crocodile, is a species of crocodile endemic to the northern regions of Australia.</p>
<p>The freshwater crocodile is a relatively small crocodilian. Males can grow to 2.3-3 m long, while females reach a maximum size of 2.1 m. Males commonly weigh around 70 kg, with large specimens up to 100 kg or more, against the female weight of 40 kg. Unlike their much larger Australian relative, the saltwater crocodile, freshwater crocodiles are not known as man-eaters and rarely cause fatalities, although they will bite in self-defence if cornered.</p>
