<p>Kookaburras are terrestrial tree kingfishers native to Australia and New Guinea, which grow to between 28–42 cm in length.</p>
<p>They are found in habitats ranging from humid forest to arid savanna, as well as in suburban areas with tall trees or near running water. Even though they belong to the larger group known as "kingfishers", kookaburras are not closely associated with water.</p>
<p>Kookaburras are almost exclusively carnivorous, eating mice, snakes, insects, small reptiles, and the young of other birds.</p>
