<p>The little penguin is the smallest species of penguin. It grows to an average of 33 cm in height and 43 cm in length, though specific measurements vary by subspecies. It is found on the coastlines of southern Australia and New Zealand. In Australia, they are often called fairy penguins because of their small size.</p>
<p>Like those of all penguins, the little penguin's wings have developed into flippers used for swimming. The head and upper parts are blue in colour, with slate-grey ear coverts fading to white underneath, from the chin to the belly. Their flippers are blue in colour.</p>
