<p>The didgeridoo is a wind instrument developed by Indigenous Australians of northern Australia potentially within the last 1,500 years and still in widespread use today both in Australia and around the world. It is sometimes described as a natural wooden trumpet or "drone pipe".</p>
<p>Many didgeridoos are painted using traditional or modern paints by either their maker or a dedicated artist; however, it is not essential that the instrument be decorated. It is also common to retain the natural wood grain with minimal or no decoration.</p>
